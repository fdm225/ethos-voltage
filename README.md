# ethos-voltage

Project to track various voltage related things using the FrSky FLVSS sensors.  


Current Features:
- Track the min voltage throughout the run

Future Features
- Check to see if the battery is full after start/reset
- monitor individual cells to ensure that the voltage differential is within limits (e.g. .3v)
- monitor for lost/missing cells

requirements: FrSky FLVSS/MLVSS
